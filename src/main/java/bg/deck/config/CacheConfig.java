/**

 * request and written by hand a few times a year, so reading the table each
 * time would be a query per request for an answer that almost never changes.
 *
 * <p>The expiry is the point, not the speed. It is the promise made to whoever
 * switches a game off during an incident: an {@code UPDATE} against
 * {@code available_service} takes effect within {@link #SERVICES_TTL}, with no
 * deploy, no restart and nothing to remember to do afterwards. Caffeine is here
 * for that expiry — the simple cache manager Boot would otherwise give us holds
 * an entry for ever, which would turn that promise into a restart.
