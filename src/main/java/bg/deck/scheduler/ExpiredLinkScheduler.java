/**
 * Retires the links nobody came back for.
 *
 * <p>A link is refused on age the moment someone uses it, so this changes no
 * answer the service gives. What it changes is what the tables say: without it
 * a link nobody ever opens sits at PENDING for good, and reading the row tells
 * you the opposite of the truth — which is exactly how an expired reset once
 * looked like a working one.
 *
 * <p>Runs on its own schedule under a lock held in the database. During a
 * deploy the old instance and the new one overlap, and only one of them should
 * do this.

 * @see bg.deck.config.SchedulingConfig for the pool, the lock and the timings
