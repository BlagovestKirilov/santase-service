/**
 * The cached reads, and the only class that speaks to
 * {@link AvailableServiceRepository}.
 *
 * <p>Today there is one such read: the catalogue of games on offer, which
 * nearly every request needs and which changes a few times a year.
 *
 * <p>It is a class of its own rather than a method on {@link AvailabilityService}
 * because {@code @Cacheable} is applied by a proxy around the bean, and a bean
 * calling its own method never goes through that proxy. The caller has to
 * arrive from outside, so a cached read cannot sit beside the code that uses
 * it. Anything else worth caching later belongs here for the same reason.
 *
 * <p>How long an entry lives is {@link bg.deck.config.CacheConfig}'s business,
 * not this class's.
