/**
 * The board seen from the side that is about to move — the single most important
 * abstraction in this engine.
 *
 * <p>Indices run 1..24 for points plus {@link #BAR} (25) for the bar, always
 * counting <em>distance from the mover's off tray</em>. In this frame the mover
 * always travels from a higher index to a lower one, which collapses three
 * separate rules into one arithmetic expression:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>ordinary move — {@code to = from - die}</li>
 *   <li>enter from the bar — {@code to = 25 - die}, i.e. {@code from - die} with {@code from = BAR}</li>
 *   <li>bear off — {@code to = from - die <= 0}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Writing the rules twice, once per direction, is where backgammon
 * implementations go wrong. This type exists so they are written once.
