/**
 * What is left of an account after it is deleted: a name for the seat.
 *
 * <p>Finished games still have to say who sat in them, so the username stays
 * and the row with it. Nothing else does: no email, no password hash, no IP
 * address.
 *
 * <p>Extends {@link BaseEntity}, not {@code BaseUser}. Inheriting the user's
 * shape was what made deletion copy the whole account — every field the two
 * classes shared came across, and stayed for good. A tombstone is not a user,
 * and now cannot hold what a user holds. Changeset 016 drops the columns those
 * fields used to occupy.
