 * Settling one deal. RULES §8.

 *   <li><b>made</b> — the callers took more, and each side records its own;</li>
 *   <li><b>вътре</b> — the others took more, and record <em>everything</em>,
 *       both sides' points together, while the callers record nothing;</li>
 *   <li><b>висящи</b> — level. The callers record nothing and their points wait
 *       for whoever wins the next deal; the others record theirs as usual.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The points passed in are the finished ones: cards, declarations, the last
 * trick and capot. A contra doubles what goes on the sheet, and points left
 * hanging carry forward already doubled.
