/**
 * What a seat is allowed to play, given what is already on the table.

 * <p>The rules, from RULES §6: follow the led suit if you hold it; if you do
 * not and <em>an opponent</em> is winning the trick, you must trump, and
 * overtrump if an opponent has already trumped. When your own partner holds the
 * trick there is no obligation at all — "ако взятката до момента принадлежи на
 * противника" is the whole of the condition.

 * <p>Two branches the rules page does not settle are marked below as OPEN 12

 * change once answered, and each has a test that names the question.
