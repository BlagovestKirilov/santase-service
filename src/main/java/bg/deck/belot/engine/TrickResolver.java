/**
 * Who is winning a trick, and who took it.
 *
 * <p>Three ways a card can stand, worst first: it followed neither the led suit
 * nor the trump suit and cannot win at all; it followed the led suit; it is a
 * trump. Within one of those, the higher card by the contract's own order wins.
 *
 * <p>All trumps and no trumps have no separate trump suit — every suit is read
 * by the same order — so there only the led suit can win a trick. A heart on a
 * led spade loses in all trumps exactly as it does in no trumps, however high
 * it is.
