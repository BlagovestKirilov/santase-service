/**
 * The bidding, as a value that never changes: every turn produces a new one.
 *
 * <p>RULES §5. The player to the dealer's right speaks first — which, with play
 * running counter-clockwise, is the seat the deal moves to next. Each bid must
 * beat the last, and three passes in a row end it. Four passes and nobody has
 * bid: the hand is thrown in and the next seat deals.
 *
 * <p>Contra can only come from an opponent of whoever holds the contract, and
 * recontra only from the side that holds it.
 *
 * @param dealer     who dealt this hand
 * @param toAct      whose turn it is to speak
 * @param highestBid the highest contract bid so far, or null
 * @param bidder     the seat that bid it, or null
 * @param doubling   plain, contra'd or recontra'd
 * @param passes     how many have passed in a row
 * @param anyBid     whether anyone has bid at all
