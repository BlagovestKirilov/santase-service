/**
 * Someone who has played belot, as belot knows them.
 *
 * <p>Known by username and nothing else. That name is the token's subject, it
 * is fixed at registration and there is no rename anywhere in the service, so
 * it identifies a person without belot ever reading {@code public.users}. The
 * row is created the first time its owner asks belot for anything.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not a foreign key to a user: the whole point of the schema is
 * that these tables can be lifted into a service of their own without unpicking
 * a join. See {@code docs/belot/BUILD.md}.
