/**
 * A table of belot: its four seats, its score sheet, and the seed its deals are
 * shuffled from.
 *
 * <p>The deck is never stored. Every deal is dealt again from {@code serverSeed}
 * and the deal's number, so the shuffle is reproducible and, once the seed is
 * revealed at the end, checkable by the players — the hash of it is shown
 * before a card is dealt. Табла's dice work the same way.
