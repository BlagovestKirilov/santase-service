/**
 * The table as one player sees it — and nothing they may not see.

 * <p>A separate one of these is built for every seat. {@code yourHand} is the
 * only private thing in it, and it is the reason the view is per seat rather
 * than one state broadcast to the table: a hand that reaches the wrong client
 * has been leaked no matter what the client then does with it.

 * @param gameId          the table

 * @param serverSeedHash  committed before the first card; the seed follows at the end
 * @param seats           who is sitting where
 * @param yourSeat        where the player being sent this is sitting
 * @param dealNumber      which hand, counted from one; null before the first
